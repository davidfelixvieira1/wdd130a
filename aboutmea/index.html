   <h2>David Vieira</h2>
   <p>Hello guys! I hope you are doing amazing! So, my name is David Vieira and my degree is Software Engineer. I'm married with my dear wife Claudia and we are so happy together. The happiest day of my life was when we got sealed for this life and all eternity. I'm currently working in an English Speaking Call Center and I'm a team leader in the company, I'm grateful to learn every day with everyone there and I hope to keep doing my best to help our agents. The most important thing for me while studying at BYU-Idaho is the way that we can learn more about the gospel meanwhile we are studying. This is amazing for me and I'm really grateful for that. I hope to do my best here in this course and degree, to be able to achieve great places with my wife and that we can serve God in a better way, giving our whole life to Him and his work.  </p>
   <p2>One of the things I really love to do is watch soccer. I support Botafogo in Brazil and I love this team. One my dreams is to go to watch them playing an important game and suport them all time! I hope it will happen some day to enjoy this time with my wife!</p2>
