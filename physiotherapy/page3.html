                <p>With everything that has already been said about how physiotherapy is extremely important in improving the lives of your children with motor limitations, we have prepared something very special so that you can see and analyze how our physiotherapy treatment works and helps in the process of improving your child's life.        
                    First of all, we will do an analysis with many questions about your child's problem. We will also undergo some exams to find out in depth which are the best and most effective physiotherapy sessions they will need. </p>     
            </div>

                <img src="images/rsz_1image2page3.jpg" alt="Page 3 image 2">
                <p>Regarding the exams and where you will have to take them, don't worry. We will recommend professionals in these areas who will help you with these exams.
                At the end, after we have completed our analysis with all the necessary exams and materials, we will schedule a schedule of physiotherapy sessions. Of course, analyzing the best time and availability that works best for you, parents and your respective children. After discussing the time and agenda, we will give you this agenda detailing each step that you will also need to do at home with your children to help them in this process of improvement when they are not undergoing therapy with us at the location that we will confirm with you.               
                With this in mind, you will be much more prepared for challenges and you will feel much more confident in being able to help your children have a better quality of life, and believe me: this will make a difference to them for the rest of their lives.
