      <h3>Home Page - About Me</h3>
      <p>
        •	Why will people come to your site?

        First of all, to introduce myself, I would like to say that my name is Cláudia Emilly, I am 23 years old and have a degree in physiotherapy.
        
        Some time ago I had already decided that I would major in this area. Helping people with physiotherapy has always been a life goal for me. As I saw the difference that physiotherapy can make in each person's life, I realized that this was where I belonged.
        
        We all need to take care of our health to have a better standard of living. However, something specific that I want to bring here for you is: And when we have children who have motor limitations and this makes their lives difficult, what can you as parents do to improve their lives and also consequently improve yours?
        
        Throughout the content you will see on this site, remember that physiotherapy is an essential means of developing your children and that every day, you can help them take an important step towards improving their quality of life.

      <h3>How to care for children with motor limitations?</h3>
      <p>
       •	What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?
        As parents, you may carry a question for a long time when having children with motor limitations. One of them is exactly this: How can I take care of them?

The first thing to think about is looking for a professional specialized in this area to be able to help you answer this type of question with in-depth and reliable knowledge to provide the best possible care for your children.

By having a professional specialized in this area to take care of your children with motor limitations, this physiotherapy professional will also be able to guide you on how to take specific care of your children at home. Another very important thing to highlight that you should remember as parents is: my children can have a healthier, happier and more rewarding life throughout this process to help them deal better with motor limitations.

With this in mind, you will be much more prepared for challenges and you will feel much more confident in being able to help your children have a better quality of life, and believe me: this will make a difference to them for the rest of their lives.

      <h3>Physiotherapy session offers</h3>
      <p>
        What information is needed to complete any action your website offers?

        With everything that has already been said about how physiotherapy is extremely important in improving the lives of your children with motor limitations, we have prepared something very special so that you can see and analyze how our physiotherapy treatment works and helps in the process of improving your child's life.
        
        First of all, we will do an analysis with many questions about your child's problem. We will also undergo some exams to find out in depth which are the best and most effective physiotherapy sessions they will need.
        
        Regarding the exams and where you will have to take them, don't worry. We will recommend professionals in these areas who will help you with these exams.
        
        At the end, after we have completed our analysis with all the necessary exams and materials, we will schedule a schedule of physiotherapy sessions. Of course, analyzing the best time and availability that works best for you, parents and your respective children. After discussing the time and agenda, we will give you this agenda detailing each step that you will also need to do at home with your children to help them in this process of improvement when they are not undergoing therapy with us at the location that we will confirm with you.
