            <p>Some time ago I had already decided that I would major in this area. Helping people with physiotherapy has always been a life goal for me. As I saw the difference that physiotherapy can make in each person's life, I realized that this was where I belonged.
                We all need to take care of our health to have a better standard of living. However, something specific that I want to bring here for you is: And when we have children who have motor limitations and this makes their lives difficult, what can you as parents do to improve their lives and also consequently improve yours?
                Throughout the content you will see on this site, remember that physiotherapy is an essential means of developing your children and that every day, you can help them take an important step towards improving their quality of life. </p>
